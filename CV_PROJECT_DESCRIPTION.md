## üìã Professional Summary for CV

### **Project Overview (50-70 words)**
```
Developed an intelligent e-commerce platform combining React/TypeScript frontend with Flask backend, 
integrating Google Gemini AI for outfit recommendations and real-time Selenium web scraping from Meesho. 
Features include multi-modal search (text/image/voice), AI-powered outfit completion, smart wishlist 
management, and parallel processing architecture. Implemented complete CRUD operations with Supabase 
database and responsive UI with custom Meesho branding.
```

### **Detailed Description (100-150 words)**
```
Engineered a sophisticated AI-driven fashion discovery platform that revolutionizes online shopping 
through intelligent product curation. The system leverages Google Gemini AI for natural language 
processing and computer vision, enabling users to search using text, images, or voice commands. 
Implemented real-time web scraping using Selenium WebDriver with multi-threaded architecture 
(4 concurrent workers) to extract live product data from Meesho.com.

Key technical achievements include developing a React/TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS, 
building RESTful APIs with Flask, implementing anti-detection scraping mechanisms, and creating 
smart wishlist management with custom folder organization. The platform features responsive design 
with Meesho brand colors, real-time data processing, and intelligent outfit completion suggestions. 
Successfully integrated Supabase for user data management and deployed comprehensive error handling 
with graceful fallback mechanisms.
